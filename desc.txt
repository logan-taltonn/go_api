TAMU Grade Distribution Local RESTful API

Abilities: 
- Search class sections by class type, and their grade distributions
- Search class sections by professor, and their grade distributions
- Allows user to specify time expiration of cache

Features:
- Redis context caching, decreasing GET query time down roughly 100x (ms)
- Gorilla Mux routing for listening and serving clients
- Neat JSON return formatting and error checking around every call

Reqs To Run:
- Have Go SQL installed -> go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
    - and running locally at port :3306
- Have Gorilla Mux installed -> at terminal: go get github.com/gorilla/mux
- Have Go Redis or Microsoft Redis installed -> *** look it up, installation depends greatly ***
    - and running locally at port :6379
- Have port :8000 free

Limitations:
- Currently only has Spring2023 distributions preloaded

Other Notes:
- to have the api function, you must have mysql server & redis server active
- mysql startup -> net start mysql || Start-Service MySQL
- enter mysql -> mysql -u logan -p OR mysql -p (at root level)
- mysql shutdown -> mysqladmin -u root shutdown || Stop-Service MySQL
- redis startup -> redis-server
- redis shutdown -> redis-cli + SHUTDOWN
- must have redis on for api to function -> drives query time down roughly 100x

Speedup:
- Redis Caching -> 100x speedup of GET requests
